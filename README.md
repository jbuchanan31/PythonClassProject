Weekly Sales Project
This is a simple Python program that asks the user to enter a store's sales for each day of the week. The sales amounts are stored in a list, and the program calculates the total sales for the week and displays the result. 

My name is Joshua.
I am currently a Cyberscurity student who is looking to get into IT.  
I'm a beginner when it comes to Python, but I'm looking to improve.
The Weekly Sales program in this repository is my first to publish publicly.
